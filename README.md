# Creating Python programs in Codio


### Our idea 3 (jobs listing/career hub) Winner!
Create a website that combines a few job listing apis for users to sift through.
The website can have different tabs in the navigation bar:
* page for resume building 
* page for interview prep
* page for news about different fields

 - Resume/Career Tab - Downloadable files, External links, Video player that relates to career readiness
 - News Feed with Hacker rank/ other APIS


APi:
* jobs API's (still decidind specifc ones)
* hacker news API
* youtube API


DATABASE:
* store user information (from the log in)
* allow the user to save info they are interested in (personal user page)


Steps:

- [x] Do presentation.
- [x] Get the Jooblee API working.
- [x] Get the Hacker News API working.
- [x] Get the Youtue API working.
* Get the API's working.
* See the info they return and find similarities.
- [x] Copy and use an alredy existing front end.
- [x] Have a register page.
- [x] Have a login page.
- [] Adapt register and login page.
* Adapt the front end.












### Our idea 1 (restauran)
Create a program that sorts orders. Delegating orders to different workers


inputs:
* number of workers
* orders
* worker ID (to keep track of the orders they do)

### Our idea 2 (data visualization)
Display the interaction of the code (step-by-step). Be able to do it with multiple sorting algorythms.
Display messages to enhance learning and correct missconceptionts. 
Mostly focus in improving the user experience. Even if there are few algorythms, if the experience is amazing, then it could work.
Visualization is the main key.
Focus on the main algorythms that people use.


inputs:
* algorythm user is looking for (we can give options with buttons)
* Interactive test (run test with user inputs)
* 

cons (maybe):
* use java(?)(shouldn't be that bad)
* really undestand what is happening in every example
* implement a good amount of algorythms 
* time consuming
* maybe too small (requires high time investment in oreder to be a good tool(implement various algorythms))

Big cons:
* not using databases (kind of)
* we don't really have an API XD


### Our idea 3 (jobs listing/career hub)
Create a website that combines a few job listing apis for users to sift through.
The website can have different tabs in the navigation bar
 - Resume/Career Tab - Downloadable files, External links, Video player that relates to career readiness
 - News Feed with Hacker rank/ other APIS
 
### Our idea 4 (interview preparation)
Create a website that prints interview question based on a subject they select.
We can join this idea with the jobs listing/carrer hub in order to make it cover a bigger scope.

cons:
* havent found an API with questions for interviews.
* 

### Our idea 5 (shared trips)
Create a website that allows user to share trips with people so they can save money.
Be able to choose between driver or companion.
Being a good driver or good companion can bring benefits. (rewards based on a point system)
Directed to bussineses that have people with cars.


inputs:
* people create their own user.
* they can chose to be the passanger or the driver.
* If driver: post trips they will do (location, times)
* If passenger: look for trips, specifing (location, times (stars(quality)?))
* Once passenger finds usefull trip, select and send a notificsation to the driver.
* both then can enter the grade of the other, and gain rewards (free parking, free gas, etc)
* The profile keeps track of this.

cons:
* Maybe use the google maps API (not sure if exist)
